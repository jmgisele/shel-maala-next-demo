Binya and Xava lead another shiur (talmudic discussion) for our beit midrash! This one is called Sacred Pleasure. It's from masexet Avodah Zara, and includes themes of the goddess, queens, the erotic, licentiousness and trans femininity. Content warning that it contains explicit discussions of sex. The event was be live captioned. We hope this Jewish learning space will be an opportunity to connect, replenish yourself and fuel your fight for justice.
