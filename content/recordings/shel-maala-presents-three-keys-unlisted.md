Everyone liked our last emergent beit midrash so much that we decided to do another one! No hebrew experience necessary. Studying Talmud is a practice that helps me hone the skill of reinterpreting the past and energizes me to work for a future of liberation for all. So of course I want to study during pandemic! No Hebrew knowledge required. This time we're gonna learn a really interesting sugye (section of talmud) about three divine keys, and who they're entrusted to. This time, co-facilitated by the incredible Binya Koatz!
