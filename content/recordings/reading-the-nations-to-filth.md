shortDescription: Learning anti-colonial Talmud in honor of Indigenous People's Day
---
<!--StartFragment-->

This Indigenous People's Day weekend, join tgirl talmud princesses, Binya and Xava, in learning a juicy piece of Talmud, where Hashem drags empires like they were low-budget queens in a category two steps above their pay-grade.

We'll learn this rad/complicated text in its original, and translate it together and have a group discussion, along with practical organizing around indigenous reparation in our community today.\*\*

The event will be live captioned and include an opportunity to donate to organizations leading the fight for Indigenous rematriation. We hope this Jewish learning space will be an opportunity to connect, replenish and fuel your fight for justice.
