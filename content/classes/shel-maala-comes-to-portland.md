Shel Maala, your favorite online queer Yeshiva, is coming DOWN FROM THE CLOUD for the \*first time ever\*, in partnership with Shir Tikvah of Portland, to offer a weekend of prayer, gay content and shtark Talmud learning in the Pacific Northwest.

The weekend of November 10-12, Rosh Yeshivas Xava and Binya will be flying into Portland to lead all this good stuff at East Side Jewish Commons:

* Friday Night Kabbalat Shabbat

  * 6-7:30 PM at EJC
  *  Binya and Xava will lead us in welcoming the Shabbos queen with a traditional kabbalat shabbat service.
  * Register at this [link](https://dinners.onetable.org/events/f9bcbbff-0198-4dd8-b6ff-a73c1521afc1?shared=true)
* Saturday Morning Torah Study

  * 9-10 AM at EJC
  * Xava will guide Torah study on parshat Xayei Sarah, a parsha which explores themes deeply connected to our weekend’s Talmud sugye of love, loss, life and death.
  * No prerequisites or cost, but you’ll probably get the most out of it if you take a moment to read the parshah beforehand. 
* Saturday Night Havdallah

  * 6-7 PM at EJC
  * Ease out of Shabbat and into the week with a casual havdallah lead by Binya before we head out on the town for an evening out just socializing. 
  * No prerequisites or cost, just come!
* Sunday Full Day of Learning

  * 1-6 PM at EJC
  * A full day of xevruta text study at East Side Jewish Commons exploring an incredible piece of Talmud. 
  * You can come with a study partner, or we’ll pair you up with someone at your level
  * Knowing your alefbet is a prerequisite, and we can help you learn it for this class if needed. If you haven’t studied in the Svara method, you’ll be expected to watch an intro video.
  * We’ll be studying an amazing Mishna about Hashem, creation, and the wisdom of loss.
  * 54$, pay what you can
