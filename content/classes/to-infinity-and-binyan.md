We gave this class a longggg time ago. But if you're new to Shel Maala or just want a refresher, come hang with Xava and I for a Sunday afternoon/evening to brush up on your binyanim - the 'verb drag' that hebrew verbs put on to make meaning. Learn about simple, causitive, reflexive verbs and more; study the basic patterns that'll help you unlock your readings; and learn to feel the rhythms of ancient rabbinic language in your bones.

This'll be recorded and put up on the Shel Maala website afterwards, and can't wait for you all to be there! to make a donation, hit up @bkoatz on venmo or @binyakoatz on paypal.
