The letters of the alef-bet aren’t just scratches on parchment. They have their own personalities. They speak with G-d, rule over nature and emotion, and reveal hidden Torah.

Dive into the world of Jewish mysticism and numerology in Shel Maala’s next class: Alefbet Soup for the Soul: A Crash-Course in the Magic Letters of Judaism. In this three-week crash course, Shel Maala-nik dr. ada morse will lead an exploration of the alef-bet from early Kabbalistic creation stories to modern queer gematria.

Learners of all levels are welcome - all you need to know is your alef bet! If you don’t know that or want some help getting to know the Svara method, we’ve got resources to help you out! This class will be live captioned and fairied, and all the other info you need can be found below

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the Svara method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

Knowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Our second and third classes, 6/11 & 6/18, will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand.

This hour of prep can happen during the week before each class, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be held the hour immediately before class, from 3-4pm ET/12-1pm PT. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for y'all.

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

\~﻿\~~

T﻿his class is $54, NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.

N﻿OTE: For this class, there is an option to audit. This would mean that you would not get paired with a xevruta, but could come to classes/watch recordings. This is optimal for people who cannot make several of the class times, but still want access to the learning/materials. Please reach fill out the form below, if you'd like to audit in this fashion:
