12:30-1:30pm (Lunch)

1:30-5pm (Shiur, Meaning-Making, Wrap-Up, ample breaks)



\~\~~



You can come with a study partner, or we’ll pair you up with someone at your level

Knowing your alefbet is a prerequisite, and we can help you learn it for this class if needed. If you haven’t studied in the Svara method, you’ll be expected to watch an intro video. See more below.

We’ll be studying an amazing Mishna about Hashem, creation, and the wisdom of loss.

Here’s more on the text we’ll be studying:

*Why don’t things last forever? What was on Hashem’s mind when She was creating the world? The answers given to us by the Sages can teach us about why things fall apart and how to let go when they do. In xevruta learning pairs, we’ll explore this wisdom and Berukha HaShem we’ll get to bring it to you live!*



\~\~~

The Sunday learning will be a text study class, where text will be learned in the Svara method of Talmud study. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary to sign up, but you will be expected to watch the intro video(s) we will email you, if you are new to the method.

Knowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so, just indicate that in your form



\~\~~



Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta (pair) study. You will be matched with a xevruta (study partner) after registration, based on the answers you provide!

There will be lots of yummy food and discussion. If you haven’t been in a physical Talmud learning space before, come and get excited!
