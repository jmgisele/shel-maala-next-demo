Do you want to learn to read and write in Hebrew? Is it because you just want to understand what the shapes of the letters mean? Or do you have a bigger goal in mind? Together we can take that first step either for its own sake, or so that you can start learning how to chant Torah, understand the siddur, or even study Talmud (with us!). If you’re a beginner or just wanting to refresh your skills, this is the class for you!

BOTH OF SHEL MAALA’S ROSH YESHIVAS - R’ Xava de Cordova and Binya Kóatz, teach the alef bet in this must-have class for new beginners in the SVARA method.

Perfect for beginners, no pre-knowledge required. This class will be live captioned.

\~ \~~

Four Sundays

August 18 -> September 8

2-3:30pm ET/11am-12:30pm PT

\~\~~

Accessibility notes:

\~\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and small group study. We’ll introduce you to your small group during our first class session. There is no formal pre-class xevruta work needed for this shiur, however you will get a lot more out of it if you set aside some time each week to practice the letters we learn. 10-15 minutes a day can make a huge difference in sharpening up your Hebrew reading skills. We’ll talk about homework options in each class session.

\~\~~

This class is $36/class ($144 total), NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.
