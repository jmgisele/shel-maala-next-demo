Together with superstar teacher Ayelet HaShachar Adelman, let's spill the **H**erbal **R**abbinic **T**ea and uncover how the Rabbis wielded the magic of the natural world to change bodies, and what that means for us as queer & trans Jews, Jewish women, and Jewish radicals today.

T﻿exts include passages from the Talmud, modern Jewish herbalism, and more.

\~﻿\~~

Five S﻿undays

J﻿anuary 8 -> February 5

4-6pm ET/1-3pm PT

\~﻿\~~

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the Svara method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

**K﻿nowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a pre-requisite.** If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Two of our classes will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand. These classes are:

\- Jan 15 (the second class)

\- Jan 22 (the third class) 

This hour of prep can happen during the week between classes, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be from 3-4ET/12-1PT on Jan 15 and Jan 22. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for yall. 

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

\~﻿\~~

T﻿his class is $90 ($18/class), NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.

\~\~~

Accessibility notes:

\- Live captioning

\- 5-10 minute break

\- Recordings available

\- Slides & materials sent out before class

\~﻿\~~

I﻿f you have any questions please email: shelmaalayeshiva@gmail.com

N﻿OTE: For this class, **there is an option to audit**. This would meant that you would not get paired with a xevruta, but could come to classes/watch recordings. This is optimal for people who cannot make several of the class times, but still want access to the learning/materials. 

T﻿o sign up to audit, please fill out the form and send payment here according to the instructions provided here: https://forms.gle/xKg9yNuy4niAuQpY8
