This Indigenous People's Day weekend, join tgirl talmud princesses, Binya and Xava, in learning a juicy piece of Talmud, where Hashem drags empires like they were low-budget queens in a category two steps above their pay-grade.

We'll learn this rad/complicated text in its original, and translate it together and have a group discussion, along with practical organizing around indigenous reparation in our community today.\*\*

The event will be live captioned and include an opportunity to donate to organizations leading the fight for Indigenous rematriation. We hope this Jewish learning space will be an opportunity to connect, replenish and fuel your fight for justice.

Who are we?

Xava De Cordova is a Jewish educator, Talmudic scholar, future rabbi, neo-xasid, and writer living in Providence, Rhode Island. She cut her teeth as a teacher founding Beit Midrash Behind Bars, an organization that created Jewish study opportunities for incarcerated people inside Washington State prisons. She helps facilitate Shalem, an egalitarian xavurah in Providence. She's also the co-host of the podcast Xai, how are you?

Binya Kóatz is a transgirl living on Ohlone land in the East Bay, trying to honor her ancestors by leaving a gayer world for her children (be’h) than the one she found. She organizes Jewish community around ICE, the Occupation and diasporic Jewish culture

\*\* Please note - Not all Jews owe Indigenous reparations. This is because there are people Indigenous to Turtle Island, who are also Jewish.
