In March of 5783, the Trans Halakha Project released two groundbreaking projects: a series of Trans Teshuvot (Jewish legal responses), answering core questions of Jewish law for and about trans people; and Tefillat Trans, a book of blessings and rituals written by and for trans people.

Since that time, we find ourselves in a powerful moment, as trans Jews across the world studying, praying, and practicing according to the words and hiddushim (insights) of their own siblings and peers. Jews who are not trans have begun learning from the universally applicable truths in our Torah. A new halakha is emerging, and in this generation, we are blessed to be able to witness the blossoming of the next trans codex (collection of legal writings).

This Fall, we will have the tantalizing opportunity to hear first-hand from the sages who helped bring these projects to fruition. Join the Trans Halakha Project and Shel Maala for a shiur (lecture) series by the creators of these incredible new pieces of Torah, where we will dive deep into their works: Learn about their process, unearth their insights, reveal their questions, and ask your own. Brilliant Teshuva-writers and the editors of the Tefillat Trans will be on-hand to help you explore the world of trans halakha and tefilla, to give you the chance to bring them into your practice and life.
