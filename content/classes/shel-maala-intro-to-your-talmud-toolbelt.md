Come spend your last Wednseday evening in June stocking up your Talmud Toolbelt with Shel Maala, the digital-first queer yeshiva.

This is a FREE crash course-session designed for anyone new to the SVARA method of Talmud learning or for those who just want a refresher. Together, we’ll gather up some sweet gadgets and tools, and geek out as we walk through the basics of the method that we’ve been handed down from our teachers and that our yeshiva is built around. You'll learn how to xevruta (study in traditional talmud pairs), how to use your dictionaries, tips for finding the root of ancient Aramaic + Hebrew words (even without knowing the language!) and much much more. At the end of it all, you’ll be able to study 2000 year-old talmud texts, in their original, unvocalized language, JUST with these tools. It sounds unbelievable, but believe us - we learned it this way too!

If you're planning to take future Shel Maala classes and you haven't learned in this method before, come to this class so you can be prepared. This class will be recorded for future usage by Shel Maala students.

Helpful pre-req for this class: Know your alef-bet! We’ll be posting some pre-class material in the event feed for those who want to learn the aleph bet. You can still attend this class if you do not ![❤](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ted/2/16/2764.png)
