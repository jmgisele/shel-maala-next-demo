Do you ever look at the sky and think about God? The folks who brought us the Zohar sure did. Get ready to lift yourself up to the place where all eyes gaze - and make sure to bring every question you’ve ever thought! Cuz we’re taking a trip to the mysterious Ancient One whose “Ask Me Anything” booth sits at the end of heaven itself.

Mystical mistress extraordinaire Lexi Kohanski is back, and this time, in a Shel Maala first, she’s gonna be plunging us headfirst into the Zohar. This 4-week Svara-style course will introduce you into the secrets of the world-changing mystical kabbalistic tome, all in the original Aramaic. Expect deep text study, spiritual puns, and a deeper understanding of the mysteries that lie at the foundation of the universe.

Open to learners of all levels, all you need to know is your alef bet. If you want help learning that or the Svara-style method of learning we’ll be using, we’ve got resources for you! This class will be live captioned and fairied by Rosh Yeshivas Xava de Cordova and Binya Kóatz.

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the SVARA method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

Knowing your alef-bet (Hebrew alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Three of our classes will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand. These classes are: 12/20, 12/27, and 1/3.

This hour of prep can happen during the week between classes, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be held the hour immediately before class, from 7-8pm ET/4-5pm PT. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for y'all.

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

\~﻿\~~

T﻿his class is $36/class ($144 total), NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.

N﻿OTE: For this class, there is an option to audit. This would mean that you would not get paired with a xevruta, but could come to classes/watch recordings. This is optimal for people who cannot make several of the class times, but still want access to the learning/materials. You will see the option as a separate “audit” ticket at check out.
