Shel Maala’s first guest teacher, Olivia Devorah Tucker, invites us to learn and bring new interpretations to an ancient communal ritual for responding to bad dreams: 

“Deep in Berakhot (the Talmud volume on Blessings), the early Rabbis offer a zine-length treatise on dreams. ‘Dreams are 1/60th of Prophecy,’ they proclaim, offering both detailed guides for interpreting dreams and dire warnings about doing so. The Queer Jewish fasciation with dreams goes back as far as Jacob and Joseph, anscestors of our girl Rabbi Yochanan, whose transmogrificational ritual for nightmares and troubling dreams we will learn in this 5-session series.

Participants are encouraged to keep a sefer chalomot (dream journal) during the course, and are invited to develop and share artwork, poetry, and more connected to the themes of the class.

When we recover our ancestral knowledge of these magical Talmudic practices, we get to open exciting gateways to ancient texts and try out imaginative lenses for understanding and healing the world in unconventional ways.”
