Join UK-based Kohanot at Yelala & US-based queer yeshiva, Shel Maala in an interactive exploration of a trans feminine fertility ritual in the Talmud

Shel Maala, your online Queer Yeshiva, is getting ready to fly to England to teach in late July. And Yelala, your UK-based Kohanot, are preparing the way! As Shel Maala get ready to physically hop the pond, join us to herald their arrival, with a can’t-miss one-time shiur on *Trancestors and Chalices: A Talmudic Trans Fertility Ritual for All Lovers of Beauty.*

The Talmud is a 2000-year old Jewish text filled with legal minutiae, mind-numbing logic puzzles, and hundreds of pages of complex tort law. But, dotted throughout this inky landscape are also brilliant gems of radical thought, exemplary humanity, and even divine femininity. In this class, we’ll be learning one of those gems.

Taught by Rosh Yeshivas Binya and Xava, and hosted by Kohenet Rachel Rose Reid, we’ll take a two hour journey into Rabbi Yohanan - the most beautiful Rabbi in the Talmud, and the ritual described by our Sages for manifesting their beauty.

Together, we’ll make a *Yohananya Chalice*, a ritual embodying trans fertility, the divine feminine, and so much more, and uncover the brilliance of this ancient text
