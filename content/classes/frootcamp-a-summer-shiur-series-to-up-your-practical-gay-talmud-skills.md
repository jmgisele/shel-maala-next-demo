Suit Up and Fruit Up you nerdy gemara-babes, and get ready for Frootcamp - your chance to upscale your practical gay Talmud skills before the New Year starts. Over the course of three long summer evenings, we’ll be diving into different Talmudic topics that’ll make you a better learner, a braver explorer of the daf, and hopefully a more confident shaper of the gay jewish world that’s bubbling out from under our feet

These three classes will be taught by two women whose brilliance is only outmatched by their beauty, our Rosh Yeshivas Binya Kóatz and Xava de Cordova. The classes are:

Aug. 16th: The Shape of Revelation: A Journey Through the Silhouette of a Page of Talmud, taught by Binya

Aug. 23rd: The Bare-amaic Essentials: Start Turning your Hebrew Knowledge into Aramaic Mastery, by Xava

Aug. 30th: Lest You Think…: The Basic Talmudic Logic-Phrases that Unlock Rabbinic Dialectic, by Binya and Xava

Come for one, two or all three ! $18/class. Sign ups open til the last class is over. No pre-reqs for any class, though some Hebrew knowledge will help for The Bare-amaic Essentials. These classes will have live captioning, and recordings will be available to those who sign up!

Aug. 16th: The Shape of Revelation: A Journey Through the Silhouette of a Page of Talmud, taught by Binya

\- The Shape of Revelation will guide you through the columns, rows, margins and rings of the Talmud's printing, in a poetic and tactile exploration of the Talmudic page. There will be class participation, interactive activities, prompts, history, and more!

Aug. 23rd: The Bare-amaic Essentials: Start Turning your Hebrew Knowledge into Aramaic Mastery, by Xava

\-﻿ Making the leap into Aramaic doesn’t have to be scary! In The Bare-amaic Essentials, we’ll discover all the tools you need to make the jump from Hebrew to its less familiar sister and unlock the language of the Gemara together. Mostly lecture with lots of examples, discussion time and hands-on practice!

Aug. 30th: Lest You Think…: The Basic Talmudic Logic-Phrases that Unlock Rabbinic Dialectic, by Binya and Xava

\-﻿ The Talmud is not a book. It's a mind-expanding exercise, designed to help you hold contradiction as truth. In this class, we'll dive deep into the building blocks of Rabbinic Logic and exegesis, and unearth a few key dialectical phrases that'll help you stay balanced in the wild twists and turns of the Talmud's logical acrobatics. Mostly lecture, with lots of q&a and participation!
