The beit midrash can be a noisy place. Students arguing, pages rustling, teachers expounding up at their lectern. And the incessant singing—yes, singing! From the lilts of Talmudic intonations, to the trop used to chant the holy Torah, why did our transcestors demand that we sing when we learn, and learn when we sing? In this class, Robin Banerji, a homegrown Shel Maala superstar, will help us dive deep into a halaxa (jewish law) from the fabulous Masechet Megillah, and enrich our learning with commentaries. Plus, we’ll revel in a juicy midrash with whining Torahs, shwasty Torah scholars, and the sexiest book of the Tanakh. Along the way, we’ll sing, dance, chant, laugh, love, and pray.

Open to learners of all levels, all you need to know is your alef bet. If you want help learning that or the Svara-style method of learning we’ll be using, we’ve got resources for you! This class will be live captioned and fairied by Rosh Yeshivas Xava de Cordova and Binya Kóatz, and Shel Maala teacher-dream, Olivia Devorah.

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the Svara method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

Knowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Two of our classes will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand. These classes are: 7/23 and 7/30.

This hour of prep can happen during the week between classes, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be held the hour immediately before class, from 1-2pm ET/10-11am PT. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for y'all.

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

T﻿his class is $54, NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.
