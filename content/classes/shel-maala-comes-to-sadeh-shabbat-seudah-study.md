Shel Maala, your favorite online queer Yeshiva, is coming DOWN FROM THE CLOUD just outside of \*LONDON ENGLAND\*, at Sadeh Farm in Orpington, Kent, to offer a weekend of Shabbes, Seudahs (feasts) and shtark Talmud learning in Europe for our first time ever.

The weekend of July 26-28, Rosh Yeshivas Xava and Binya will be flying into Heathrow to lead a full weekend of rad Jewish farm goodness:

**\- Friday Night Kabbalat Shabbat & Dinner**

**\- Shabbat Day - Three meals, Torah Study and Havdallah**

**\- Sunday Full Day of Badass Talmud Learning**

We cannot WAIT to spend a whole weekend luxuriating in Torah, Talmud and prayer with y’all! There are two ticket options available on this eventbrite:

\- Come for the whole weekend (£100-200, PWYC)

\- Come just for Sunday Learning (£70-100, PWYC)

These two types of tickets are available at checkout

In terms of studying, you can come with a study partner, or we’ll pair you up with someone at your level

Knowing your alefbet is a prerequisite, and we can help you learn it for this class if needed. If you haven’t studied in the Svara method, you’ll be expected to watch an intro video. See more below.

We’ll be studying an amazing Mishna about Hashem, creation, and the wisdom of loss.

Here’s more on the text we’ll be studying:

*Why don’t things last forever? What was on Hashem’s mind when She was creating the world? The answers given to us by the Sages can teach us about why things fall apart and how to let go when they do. In xevruta learning pairs, we’ll explore this wisdom and Berukha HaShem we’ll get to bring it to you live!*
