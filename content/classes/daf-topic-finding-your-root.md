Did you know that the Talmud is our gay ancestral playground?\
And did you know that YOU (yes you!) have what it takes to come play?!?

If you:\
look at a beautiful, brambly page of talmud and want to discover the tools to decode it\
learned your alef-bet and now are looking to dive into Jewish texts\
got yourself some Hebrew dictionaries (or found them online!) but aren’t sure how to effectively use them

Then this is the class for you! Join transgirl talmud teachers Binya Kóatz and Xava De Cordova as we share our process for translating rabbinic texts in a class specifically designed to help you study Talmud without ever stepping into a physical Beit Midrash.
