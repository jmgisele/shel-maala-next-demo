This is the situation: There is a sorb tree not far away from the city in which you live. In the sorb tree, there are no less than sixty demons. Would you be able to write an effective amulet to protect your people, or will the demons taunt you with their songs and send you crying back home?

Stuff like this happens more often than you think. And if you don’t know the answer to the question above, then luckily, we have a class for you.

Olivia Devorah Tucker, our beloved superstar teacher of magical Jewish content, returns to Shel Maala with a story of what it was like to live alongside the sheydim (or “demons”) in Talmud times. This 5-week SVARA-style Talmud course will help you learn in xevruta to uncover the emotional stakes and practical advice needed to work with the Jewish Supernatural - just in time for Halloween. Along with deep text study, this is going to be a hands-on, artistic adventure. Creative interpretations (visual art, performance, poetry, amulets, etc.) based on our learning will be celebrated throughout the 5-weeks, culminating in a Sugya Show-and-Tell in the final week!

Open to learners of all levels, all you need to know is your alef bet. If you want help learning that or the SVARA-style method of learning we’ll be using, we’ve got resources for you! This class will be live captioned and fairied by Rosh Yeshivas Xava de Cordova and Binya Kóatz, and Shel Maala uber-babe, Lexi Kohanski.

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the SVARA method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

Knowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Three of our classes will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand. These classes are: 10/29, 11/5 and 11/12 (the middle three).

This hour of prep can happen during the week between classes, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be held the hour immediately before class, from 1-2pm ET/10-11am PT. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for y'all.

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

T﻿his class is $36/class ($180 total), NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.

N﻿OTE: For this class, there is an option to audit. This would mean that you would not get paired with a xevruta, but could come to classes/watch recordings. This is optimal for people who cannot make several of the class times, but still want access to the learning/materials. Please sign up to audit here
