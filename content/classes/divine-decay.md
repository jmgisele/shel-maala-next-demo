Shel Maala, your favorite online queer Yeshiva, is coming DOWN FROM THE CLOUD for the \*first time ever\*, in partnership with Shir Tikvah of Portland, to offer a weekend of prayer, gay content and shtark Talmud learning in the Pacific Northwest

The weekend of November 10-12, Rosh Yeshivas Xava and Binya will be flying into PDX to lead:

* Friday Night Kabbalat Shabbat 
* Saturday Morning Torah Study
* Saturday Night Havdallah
* Sunday Full Day of Learning

Saturday Torah study and Havdallah are free and open to the public - just show up! Friday night Kabbalat Shabbat is also open to all who register at this [link](https://dinners.onetable.org/events/f9bcbbff-0198-4dd8-b6ff-a73c1521afc1?shared=true). This is the signup form for the Sunday Full Day of Learning. Here’s the details on that:

* When: Sunday Nov 12, 1-6pm (includes a break in the middle!)
* Where: East Side Jewish Commons
* You can come with a study partner, or we’ll pair you up with someone at your level
* Knowing your alefbet is a prerequisite, and we can help you learn it for this class if needed. If you haven’t studied in the Svara method, you’ll be expected to watch an intro video. See more below
* We’ll be studying an amazing Mishna about Hashem, creation, and the wisdom of loss.

Here’s more on the text we’ll be studying:

Why don’t things last forever? What was on HaShem’s mind when She was creating the world? The answers given to us by the Sages can teach us about why things fall apart and how to let go when they do. In xevruta learning pairs, we’ll explore this wisdom and Berukha HaShem we’ll get to bring it to you live!
