What makes a life well-lived? Does the answer have anything to do with Jewish agricultural law? What spiritual and personal practices stay with us throughout our existence? Do our good deeds get rewarded in the World to Come?

All of this and more is at the heart of Shel Maala’s next class, Beyond Measure! Rosh Yeshiva Xava De Cordova will lead us in an exploration of a single, glorious and juicy mishnah plus its connected Biblical and liturgical texts. We’ll discover some things about Temple tax law, some things about the afterlife, and even more about the nature of doing and being good. This text exists at the intersection of nitty-gritty practical Talmud and lofty glittery ethical Talmud!

This class is a deep-dive into one paragraph of the Rabbinic Jewish text known as the Mishna, and learners of all levels are welcome - all you need to know is your alef bet! If you don’t know that or want some help getting to know the Svara method, we’ve got resources to help you out! This class will be live captioned and fairied by our other Rosh Yeshiva, Binya Kóatz.

T﻿his is a text study class, where most text will be learned in the Svara method of Talmud. Previous knowledge of this method is not necessary, as we will provide pre-class introductory materials for this method for those who need it.

Knowing your alef-bet (Jewish alphabet) is a prerequisite. If you would like to learn your alef-bet for this class, we can help you do so.

\~﻿\~~

Learning will be a mix of full group and xevruta/pair study. You will be matched with a xevruta after registration.

Two of our classes will require an hour of xevruta prep beforehand. These classes are: 4/30 and 5/7. 

This hour of prep can happen during the week between classes, or during a guided hour right before class. The guided hour will be held the hour immediately before class, from 1-2pm ET/10-11am PT. It will include a 10 minute break before class starts. You and your xevruta will decide which option works best for y'all.

More info and instruction will be sent after registration.

T﻿his class is $90, NOTAFLOF. Full sliding scale will be shown at checkout.

N﻿OTE: For this class, there is an option to audit. This would mean that you would not get paired with a xevruta, but could come to classes/watch recordings. This is optimal for people who cannot make several of the class times, but still want access to the learning/materials. Please reach fill out the form below, if you'd like to audit in this fashion:
